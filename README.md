# State of the City

The goal of this project is to build a corpus of State of the City speeches made by mayors across America. Right now I'm focusing three years of speeches from the twenty largest cities in America and am tracking my progress [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSFkKQ-GODmmdvtESCXB1vRz-bXnqfxcJZk6KWgLueV40BEkVtNvYKLtoFE63Iju4JXpnqYFwy6YXgq/pubhtml).

As I'm collecting these data, I'm publishing a few small research projects along the way: 
- [Analyzing](http://etachov.io/sotc/2018/01/02/sentiment-of-the-city/) the sentiment of 2017 State of the City speeches
- [Figuring](http://etachov.io/projects/2017/11/05/sotc-microresearch-god-bless/) out how often mayors references a deity in their speeches
- And more to come!

Feel free to contribute speeches, edits, or analysis.
