# State of the City

The goal of this project is to build a corpus of State of the City speeches made by mayors across America. Right now I'm focusing three years of speeches from the fifteen largest cities in America and am tracking my progress [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSFkKQ-GODmmdvtESCXB1vRz-bXnqfxcJZk6KWgLueV40BEkVtNvYKLtoFE63Iju4JXpnqYFwy6YXgq/pubhtml).

Feel free to contribute speeches, edits, or analysis.
